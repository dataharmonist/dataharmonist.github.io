## Informatics Solutions for Data Harmonization in Global Research Networks

Global observational research networks can provide data for important epidemiologic analyses. Effective research in these networks depends on high quality data, adherence to a common data model, as well as timely communication within the network about research requests and data sharing. The Harmonist team at Vanderbilt University is creating a suite of software solutions to streamline these processes and facilitate meaningful research. Funding provided by the NIH (US NIAID grant R24 AI124872).

### Harmonist Tools
