## Harmonist Data Toolkit

The Harmonist Data Toolkit is a web-based application designed to provide data quality checking, report generation, and file transfer capabilities for observational research networks.

[Presentations](presentations/overview.md) are available that summarize the workflow for Toolkit users  

View [sample reports](http://dataharmonist.org/pages/reports) for examples of data summaries and data quality results presented in Harmonist Data Toolkit reports

[Code](https://github.com/IeDEA/Harmonist) for the Toolkit is written in the open-source [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/), including the [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) and [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) packages. Reproducible reports are created with RMarkdown and Shiny allows the application to be web-based and interactive. The only resource required of users is a computer with an internet connection; no additional hardware, software, or software maintenance is necessary to access the features of the Toolkit.
