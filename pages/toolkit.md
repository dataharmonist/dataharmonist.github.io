[Code](https://github.com/IeDEA/Harmonist){:target="_blank"} for the Toolkit is written in the open-source [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/), including the [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) and [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) packages. Reproducible reports are created with RMarkdown and Shiny allows the application to be web-based and interactive. The only resource required of users is a computer with an internet connection; no additional hardware, software, or software maintenance is necessary to access the features of the Toolkit.
