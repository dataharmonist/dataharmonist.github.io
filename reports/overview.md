## Harmonist Data Toolkit Example Reports

Several types of reports are automatically generated by the Toolkit, including the following:
- Toolkit Report, an overall summary of the dataset and its quality, including all patient groups, available in [PDF](ExampleHarmonistReport.pdf) or [HTML](Example Harmonist Report in HTML format.html) format.
- Toolkit Report for a single patient group
- Quality Metrics Report, a quick visual summary of data model compliance, logical consistency, and completeness for each variable in a dataset 
- Error Detail Spreadsheet, a CSV file with one record for each error detected in the dataset. Details in this record describe the error and enable a user to locate the specific dataset
